### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my naming convention and how I keep track of my tags, input values, etc.
In addition to a little practice with class manipulation.

### Continued development

For future projects I want to focus on project that are more javascript heavier. While I do enjoy creating and designing websites using HTML & CSS, I want to focus more and bringing my web apps to life.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) -The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.

## Acknowledgments

While this was just a small personal project I wanted to take on, creating a working payment screen gave me a lot of confidence and what felt like real real experience in making a web app for a client.
